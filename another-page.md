## INTRODUCTION

## Bank Data Analysis Project

&emsp; This is a brief outline of the project as this particular project is company-related (and therefore proprietary). 
I've put together this creating a relational database, running queries through SQL to gain meaningful insights and visualizing the data through Tableau. 

Examples of use cases: 
* Outline the number of funded loans by underwriter on a monthly and yearly basis to measure output across the team to measure performance 
* Determine the average interest rate by underwriter relative to the average rate across the entire team
* Rank the top 10 brokers by the number of loans funded for the year as well as the cumulative total dollar amount of funded loans 
* Isolate the percentage of deals declined relative to deals actioned by each underwriter 
* Measure the quality and accuracy of each underwriter based on their respective compliance scores for deals funded 
* List brokers by rate of declines relative to submissions to determine opportunities for coaching

## Mortgage Brokerage Analysis Project

&emsp; As a quick synopsis, I created a relational database for mortgage brokerage. Only mock data was used in the creation of this project.
